# BackbaseSubmission

This is a Backbase App.

## Summary

This app was built based on the specifications requested by Backbase.

This app loads data from a local json file, loads a dialog until the data is loaded, sorts the data alphabetically by city name and country initial, allows for searching for a particular city listed within a recyclerview, and allows a user to click on a city name, and have it displayed on a map with a marker, and a city name displayed at the center of the screen.

This app was built with one activity, using fragments, fragment animations, and a modified version of the model-view-presenter design pattern. This project also includes unit tests to check if the sorting algorithm works as expected. At the moment of submission, the concerns for this project's architecture need to be more effectively seperated in order for the tests to consistently pass.
